Tree Plantation NGO
in Pune
Nelda means champion in the Irish language and a person who lives by alder trees. Our founder, Vedarth Deshpande started Nelda with a mission to give back to the community of Pune and the earth.
 All of us at Nelda have made it our mission to plant as many trees as possible and make this world a greener place.

With that idea in mind, Project Nelda was launched in the year 2016 with a plan to help increase the green cover of Pune and help maintain the balance of urban ecosystems.
Although we have been doing this for many years, the volunteers that we have are not enough if we are to make a worthwhile change.
 We need more people to help us and support our aim to influence the plantation of a billion trees by 2041.

Tree plantation might not be the total solution to climate change, but it surely helps create a greener and much healthier future.
 When you talk about tree plantation, itâ€™s not rocket science. 
All you need is an expert and a knowledgeable team to get things done at the right time. And that is what Nelda can help with.
